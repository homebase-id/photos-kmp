 * Android: `execSQL` in the open-helper callback; iOS: `rawExecSql` in the sqliter
 * connection lifecycle), but the pragma set itself lives here.
 *
 *  - `journal_mode=WAL` — readers and the single writer don't block each other. Reads
 *    bypass [DatabaseManager]'s single-writer dispatcher and run on separate connections,
 *    so without WAL a long read + a write collide into `SQLITE_BUSY` (what knocked the
 *    desktop WebSocket offline). File-persistent.
 *  - `busy_timeout=5000` — a contended statement waits up to 5s for the lock instead of
 *    throwing `SQLITE_BUSY` immediately.
 *  - `synchronous=NORMAL` — faster, WAL-safe durability (no corruption risk; at most the
 *    last committed transaction is lost on power loss).
 *  - `temp_store=MEMORY` — temp tables/indices in RAM.
