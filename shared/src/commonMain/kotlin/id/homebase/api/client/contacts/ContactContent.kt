/**
 * The request/stored content for a V2 contact. Every field is optional.
 *
 * Serialized as camelCase via [id.homebase.api.serialization.OdinSystemSerializer], whose
 * `explicitNulls = false` config omits null fields from the JSON. That omission is load-bearing
 * for the server's merge semantics on UPDATE: a field that is absent (or empty/whitespace) means
 * "leave the existing stored value alone" — it never clears a value. Send only the fields you want
 * to set.
 *
 * [odinId] is a domain (e.g. `sam.dotyou.cloud`); omit it for a contact not tied to an identity.
 * On CREATE the server derives the contact's `uniqueId` as `md5(odinId)` when [odinId] is present,
 * otherwise a random GUID. UPDATE never re-keys a contact's identity.
